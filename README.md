# textflow
Text classification with [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/). In this project, we consider two Metaflow steps for training :
* Word embeddings pre-training with [Negative Sampling Skipgram](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf)
* Text classification with [Hierarchical Attention Networks](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf)
